Rover Genome
	Max_turn_strength

		Integer:  [50-400]

		Sets a cap on the turning radius of the rover.

			At 50 the rover can turn at a yaw between 1450 and 1550, where 1500 is straight.

			400 results in the rover being able to turn as sharp as it can

		In simulation I do not know if this will be interesting to observe, but in real life if you the rover tries turning as sharp as it mechanically can at a high speed it will tip. 

	Max_yaw_change_per_cb

		Integer: [1-100]

		Sets a cap on how much the yaw can change during each callback. The callback is tied to when lidar information is received and the default value for the simulated sensor is 10 Hz. Though we will have to pay attention to the scan frequency of the hardware we buy and adjust this accordingly.

		This is to make the simulation more realistic where the tires cannot instantly swing between the two extremes. That behavior is not desirable either and having this will result in smoother turns.

	Num_vision_cones

		Odd integer: [1-101]

		How many partitions the lidar scan is split into.

		The greater the number the smoother the impact on yaw gradient is from center of the lidar scan to the outside.

	Sweep_weight_factor

		Float: [0-5] 

		Impacts how much objects to the left or right of the rover affect the yaw. 

	Distance_weight_factor:

		Float: [0-5]

		Impacts how much objects closer or further away from the rover affect the yaw.

	Wall Distance:
		Float: [0 - 10]
		The distance at which the rover sees an object in the middle of it's vision, slows down and turns at max strength in the direction that it was already turning
